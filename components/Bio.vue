        <p>Rabbi Jean E. Eglinton grew up in Connecticut. College included a year studying at the University of Montpelier, France. In 1981 she graduated from Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio with a BA in Art. In 2010 – after devoting the interim years to her family – she was ordained a Reform Rabbi at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati. While studying at HUC-JIR, Student Rabbi Eglinton served congregations in Paducah, Kentucky; Louisville, Kentucky; and Newark, Ohio; as well as spending a summer as Student Chaplain at Cedar Village in Mason, Ohio. The student rabbi years also included a year living in Jerusalem, a week in Belarus conducting Passover Seders, and a week in Germany learning about contemporary Jews there. For her rabbinic thesis/capstone project she studied the morning creation prayer Yotzer Or, “The One Who Forms Light.” The resulting Torah Ark, which she designed and painted to express some of the many layers of history and theology contained in the prayer, continues to be a focal point of learning about prayer for people of all ages and faith backgrounds.

        <blockquote>“Instead of sitting in the synagogue waiting for Jews to come to me, I am traveling around the 3000 square miles of Appalachia we serve meeting our members where they live. Drawing and writing bits of their stories, I’ll compile them in a comic book format. You’ll see them here first!”</blockquote>
